# Netflix-Data-Visualiztion-and-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project delves into the expansive dataset of Netflix titles to explore, analyze, and visualize the composition and evolution of content over time. The objective is to provide insights into the types of content available, such as movies and TV shows, their ratings, the distribution across different countries, and more. Additionally, the project aims to predict content ratings using machine learning models.

## Data Description
The dataset includes various details about Netflix titles, such as type (movie or TV show), country of production, content rating, release year, and other descriptive information. It is sourced from Kaggle and loaded from a CSV file for analysis.

## Features of the Analysis
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and dropping unnecessary columns to prepare the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of the composition of content by type, rating, and production country, and the evolution of content over time.
Machine Learning: Building classification models to predict the content rating based on the descriptions provided for the titles.
Interactive Visualizations: Utilizing Plotly for dynamic, interactive visualizations that provide deeper insights into the data.
Word Cloud: Creating a word cloud in the shape of the Netflix logo to visualize the most common words in titles.
## Technologies Used
Python: For all data processing and machine learning tasks.
Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation.
Seaborn and Matplotlib: For static data visualization.
Plotly: For interactive data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
WordCloud: For generating word clouds.
